Comparing LM against incumbent:
gs=20 nc=0.8 ne=0.4 ps=5 xi=0.1 (48035.0 [based on 4 runs with cutoff 1000000000.0])
gs=10 nc=0.8 ne=0.4 ps=5 xi=0.6 (39047.57653061225 [based on 196 runs with cutoff 1000000000.0])
Incumbent better, keeping it
rejecting worse gs=20 nc=0.8 ne=0.4 ps=5 xi=0.1 (48035.0 [based on 4 runs with cutoff 1000000000.0]), going back to gs=10 nc=0.8 ne=0.4 ps=5 xi=0.6 (39047.57653061225 [based on 196 runs with cutoff 1000000000.0])
ParamILS has reached the specified maximum number of 1000 function evaluations => stopping the search now.
