Comparing LM against incumbent:
gs=10 nc=0.1 ne=0.8 ps=5 xi=0.4 (10951.32 [based on 25 runs with cutoff 1000000000.0])
gs=10 nc=0.8 ne=0.6 ps=5 xi=0.2 (10901.545454545454 [based on 220 runs with cutoff 1000000000.0])
Incumbent better, keeping it
rejecting worse gs=10 nc=0.1 ne=0.8 ps=5 xi=0.4 (10951.32 [based on 25 runs with cutoff 1000000000.0]), going back to gs=10 nc=0.8 ne=0.6 ps=5 xi=0.2 (10901.545454545454 [based on 220 runs with cutoff 1000000000.0])
ParamILS has reached the specified maximum number of 1000 function evaluations => stopping the search now.
