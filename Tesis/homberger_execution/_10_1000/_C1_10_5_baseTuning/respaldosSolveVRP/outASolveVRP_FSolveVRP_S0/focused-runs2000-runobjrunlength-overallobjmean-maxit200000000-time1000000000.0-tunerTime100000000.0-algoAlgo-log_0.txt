Comparing LM against incumbent:
gs=70 nc=0.4 ne=0.8 ps=5 xi=0.6 (42391.0 [based on 1 runs with cutoff 1000000000.0])
gs=20 nc=0.4 ne=0.8 ps=15 xi=0.1 (42391.9918699187 [based on 123 runs with cutoff 1000000000.0])
Incumbent better, keeping it
rejecting worse gs=70 nc=0.4 ne=0.8 ps=5 xi=0.6 (42391.0 [based on 1 runs with cutoff 1000000000.0]), going back to gs=20 nc=0.4 ne=0.8 ps=15 xi=0.1 (42391.9918699187 [based on 123 runs with cutoff 1000000000.0])
ParamILS has reached the specified maximum number of 1000 function evaluations => stopping the search now.
Final solution for depth 1 with limit N=2000, and cutoff time=1000000000.0.
