LM better, change incumbent
New Incumbent: 99.9999999999986, 16642.1 [100, 1000000000.0]. With state gs=10, nc=0.6, ne=0.4, ps=5, xi=0.2
   Accepting new better local optimum: gs=10 nc=0.6 ne=0.4 ps=5 xi=0.2 (16642.1 [based on 100 runs with cutoff 1000000000.0])
ParamILS has reached the specified maximum number of 1000 function evaluations => stopping the search now.
