Comparing LM against incumbent:
gs=20 nc=0.4 ne=0.6 ps=5 xi=0.2 (16642.625 [based on 16 runs with cutoff 1000000000.0])
gs=10 nc=0.4 ne=0.6 ps=5 xi=0.8 (16548.56 [based on 125 runs with cutoff 1000000000.0])
Incumbent better, keeping it
rejecting worse gs=20 nc=0.4 ne=0.6 ps=5 xi=0.2 (16642.625 [based on 16 runs with cutoff 1000000000.0]), going back to gs=10 nc=0.4 ne=0.6 ps=5 xi=0.8 (16548.56 [based on 125 runs with cutoff 1000000000.0])
ParamILS has reached the specified maximum number of 1000 function evaluations => stopping the search now.
