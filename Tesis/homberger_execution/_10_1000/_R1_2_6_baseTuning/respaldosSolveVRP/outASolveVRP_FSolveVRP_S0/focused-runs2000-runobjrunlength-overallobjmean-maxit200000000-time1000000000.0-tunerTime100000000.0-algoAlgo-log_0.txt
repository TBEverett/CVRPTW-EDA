Comparing LM against incumbent:
gs=20 nc=0.2 ne=0.1 ps=15 xi=0.2 (3571.25 [based on 4 runs with cutoff 1000000000.0])
gs=10 nc=0.4 ne=0.4 ps=15 xi=0.6 (3571.409836065574 [based on 61 runs with cutoff 1000000000.0])
Incumbent better, keeping it
rejecting worse gs=20 nc=0.2 ne=0.1 ps=15 xi=0.2 (3571.25 [based on 4 runs with cutoff 1000000000.0]), going back to gs=10 nc=0.4 ne=0.4 ps=15 xi=0.6 (3571.409836065574 [based on 61 runs with cutoff 1000000000.0])
ParamILS has reached the specified maximum number of 1000 function evaluations => stopping the search now.
