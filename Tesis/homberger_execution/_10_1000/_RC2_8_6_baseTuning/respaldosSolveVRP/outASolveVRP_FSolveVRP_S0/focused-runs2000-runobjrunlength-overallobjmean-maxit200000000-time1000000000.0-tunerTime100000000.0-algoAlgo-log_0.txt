LM better, change incumbent
New Incumbent: 99.9999999999986, 17950.776699029127 [103, 1000000000.0]. With state gs=20, nc=0.4, ne=0.4, ps=5, xi=0.8
same state as last ILS: gs=20 nc=0.4 ne=0.4 ps=5 xi=0.8 (17950.776699029127 [based on 103 runs with cutoff 1000000000.0])
ParamILS has reached the specified maximum number of 1000 function evaluations => stopping the search now.
